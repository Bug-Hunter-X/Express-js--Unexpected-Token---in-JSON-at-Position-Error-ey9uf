# Express.js: Unexpected Token } in JSON at Position Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky error in Express.js applications: the "Unexpected token } in JSON at position..." error. This error typically arises when the server attempts to parse a JSON payload that is malformed or contains unexpected characters.

## Scenario

A client sends a POST request to the server with JSON data in the request body.  Due to an error in the client-side code or network issues, the JSON data might be incomplete or contain syntax errors.  When the Express.js server tries to parse this invalid JSON using `req.body`, it throws the "Unexpected token } in JSON at position..." error.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a malformed POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with an invalid JSON payload (see the `bug.js` file for details on how to trigger the error).

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling on the server-side to gracefully manage invalid JSON data. This includes checking the JSON structure before processing it and providing informative error messages to the client.

## Learning Points

* Always validate JSON data received from clients.
* Use middleware to handle potential parsing errors.
* Implement comprehensive error handling to provide helpful feedback to users and maintain application stability.
